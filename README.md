ResNet-CIFAR10

This repository is a part of our Deep Learning Mini Project (CS-GY 6953)

Goal

To come up with a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture with the highest test accuracy on the CIFAR- 10 image classification dataset, under the constraint that the model has no more than 5 million parameters.

Prerequisites

Python 3.6+

PyTorch 1.0+

Notebook Explanations

fina_model.ipynb - final model, uses SGD optimizer and gives the best accuracy of 93%

DL_MiniProject_SGD_Modular.ipynb - another model using SGD optimizer but with accuracy of 92% and also our base model

DL_MiniProject_Adam_Modular.ipynb and DL_MiniProject_AdaDelta_Modular.ipynb - different variations of our base model with just the change in the optimizer used

Rest notebooks are different experiments we conducted for the given problem statement.
